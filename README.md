# UnrealPlugin

This repository should be placed in your Unreal project's plugins directory (e.g. `ProjectRoot\Plugins\FoveHMD_UnrealPlugin`).

After adding the plugin, you may have to open the Unreal Editor and rebuild the Visual Studio project. You may also have to relaunch the editor before the plugin appears in the Plugins window. Make sure it's enabled, and you should soon be able to use your headset to look around the environment!
